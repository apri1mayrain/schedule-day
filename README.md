# Work Day Scheduler

This project contains a work day (9 AM &ndash; 5 PM) scheduler and features updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and the Day.js library.

## Features/Usage

You can save hourly schedules/appointments in each timeblock using the save button. The timeblocks are color-coded to represent past (gray), present (green), and future (yellow) times.  The user will receive notice when their schedule has been saved. The schedules are saved in local storage, so when you revisit the page you can continue where you left off. Finally, there is a clear schedule button to quickly reset the schedule.
